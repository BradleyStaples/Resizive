	<p>What is Resizive? How do you say it? It's a (likely bad) pun on Responsive and Resize. It's pronounced a lot like decisive.
		Resizive aims to help finding fluid responive breakpoints easier. There are no built in presets; there's too many
		devices in too many sizes for breakpoints to be based upon 'common' device sizes. Instead, watch as your content
		flows, and create breakpoints where meaningful layout and design change should occur.</p>
	<p>Enter your site URL in the text field, press start, and watch the magic happen. It animates in steps of 50px from
		your browsers current size down to 320px wide and back. 320px is an arbitrary low point based upon device size. I'm
		not 100% sold on it, but I don't know of anything first hand that needs a smaller size to compare against. Maximize
		your browser's window to fullscreen for the best effect as it will show you the largest range of sizes, but the
		script will run regardless of your browser size, provided you're at least 320px wide of course.</p>
	<p>The width of the current 'screen' is displayed at any gime while you are resizing a website. If you notice a breakpoint
		in the animation where you think you need to apply a media query, click the pause button. Plus(+) and minus(-) buttons
		appear that step in smaller 10px increments so you can fine tune the point where you apply your media query. Just don't
		forget to recalculate this pixel number as an em for a fluid design!</p>
	<p>Note that you can use localhost as well! Simply enter <code>localhost/mywebsite/</code> and it works just as well as if
		you'd entered a live domain. Furthermore, if you need to check a specific pixel width for a breaking point, pause the
		resizing animation and edit the displayed width directly. This is very helpful for numbers that aren't multiples of 10,
		or if you just don't feel like trying to 'capture' the animation as a precise point.</p>
